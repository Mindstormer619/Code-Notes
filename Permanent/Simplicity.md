**Simplicity** refers to designing systems in ways that make it easy for new engineers to understand the system's operations. Making a system simpler does not mean reducing functionality. We generally try to remove *accidental complexity*. Complexity is accidental if it is not inherent in the problem the software solves, but arises only from the implementation.

One of the best tools for creating simplicity is **abstraction**. A good abstraction hides a lot of implementation detail behind a clean facade. This helps in code reuse and understanding, and higher quality software. However, beware over-abstracting or using the wrong abstractions. Finding good abstractions can be very hard.
