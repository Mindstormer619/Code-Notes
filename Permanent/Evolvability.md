**Evolvability** is creating systems designed for change. Requirements of users keep changing all the time, it is important to design systems which are flexible enough along the lines of commonly performed requirement updates. Also called **extensibility.**

*[[Agile]]* patterns provide a framework for adapting to change. The Agile community has developed tools and processes that make designing with extensibility easier, like TDD and continuous refactoring. But these are usually at fairly small, local scales (individual source files).
