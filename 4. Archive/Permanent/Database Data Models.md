# Types of models

## Relational

Data represented as _relations_ (tables) containing unordered _tuples_ (rows).

> E.g. PostgreSQL, MariaDB.

## NoSQL

Non-relational databases, umbrella term. Relatively recent.

NoSQL databases are used because:
+ Higher scalability -- either on large datasets or high write throughput.
+ FOSS preference over proprietary tech.
+ Specialized query operations which are hard to do in SQL.
+ More dynamic/expressive data models.

Examples of this are [[Document Databases]], [[Graph Databases]] and others.
