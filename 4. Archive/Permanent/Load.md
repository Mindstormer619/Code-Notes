**Load** is a measurement of strain on the system, indicated using **load parameters**. E.g. requests per second for a webserver, ratio of reads to writes in a DB, simultaneously active user count in a chatroom, hit rate on a cache etc.

See [[Designing Data Intensive Applications - Reliable, Scalable, Maintainable Apps#Case Study: Twitter]] for a case study of Twitter describing the *requests per second* (rps) load parameter on reads and writes, and scalability approaches for dealing with this.
