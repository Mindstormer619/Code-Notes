Languages like Golang are garbage-collected: the compiler adds some code that manages memory when your variables go out of scope. This happens at runtime. In Rust, how you write your code implicitly tells your program to free space.

**Macro:** Function with an `!` in front of it forms a macro call. E.g. `print!()` is a macro.
