# Rust Closures
> Created: 2023-02-01 22:49

Rustâ€™s **closures** are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions.

A closure is defined as `|param1, param2, ...| closureCodeGoesHere`.

Closures don't require types as a part of their signature. Type annotations are required on functions because the types are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining this interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types of values a function uses and returns. Closures, on the other hand, arenâ€™t used in an exposed interface like this: theyâ€™re stored in variables and used without naming them and exposing them to users of our library.

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: borrowing immutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership. The closure will decide which of these to use based on what the body of the function does with the captured values.

```rust
fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    let only_borrows = || println!("From closure: {:?}", list);

    println!("Before calling closure: {:?}", list);
    only_borrows();
    println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);

    borrows_mutably();
    println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
}
```

Use the `move` keyword before the params list for moving any context into the closure:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    thread::spawn(move || println!("From thread: {:?}", list)) // `list` moved here
        .join()
        .unwrap();
}
```

The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects which traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs can specify what kinds of closures they can use. Closures will automatically implement one, two, or all three of these `Fn` traits, in an additive fashion, depending on how the closureâ€™s body handles the values:

1.  `FnOnce` applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement at least this trait, because all closures can be called. A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only implement `FnOnce` and none of the other `Fn` traits, because it can only be called once.
2.  `FnMut` applies to closures that donâ€™t move captured values out of their body, but that might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than once.
3.  `Fn` applies to closures that donâ€™t move captured values out of their body and that donâ€™t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.

> ðŸ’¡ **The `Fn` traits are _additive_.** This means that any closure that implements `Fn` also automatically implements `FnMut` and `FnOnce`, any closure that implements `FnMut` also implements `FnOnce` (but need not implement `Fn`), and _any closure at all_ implements `FnOnce`. Furthermore, these trait implementations on closures are determined _automatically_ by the compiler.
