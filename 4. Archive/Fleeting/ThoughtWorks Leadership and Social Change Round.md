# ThoughtWorks Leadership and Social Change Round
> Created: 2023-06-19 17:00

## Leadership Round

> I was asked questions like,
> How would you manage conflicts between two team members? How would you manage the clients if there is an urgent requirement but you won't be able to achieve it in time? How would you convince your team members to work hard?

> How I was a team player? What kind of people I don’t like to work with? Biggest challenges faced by you and how you overcame them? How do you learn new technologies? Biggest achievement till now?

## Social Change Round

> The interviewer showed me 25 cards, each containing a different question which was divided into three sections. I had to pick three cards. 
> 
> The question on the first card was, "What do you think about feedback and what’s your experience of feedback?" For me, this question was very easy to answer because I love to get feedback. I think the benefit of feedback is seeing yourself from other people’s perspectives, which helps make you a better person.
> 
> In case you’re wondering, the questions on my second and third cards were, "What are the negative aspects of innovative technology?” and "What do you think about cultural diversity?".

> I was asked questions about my thought on aritcle 377, What do you think about LGBT rights? What do you think about CAA and protests across the country related to CAA? What do you think about women’s rights? What do you think about reservation? There is no right or wrong answer for some of these question, just try to answer positively
