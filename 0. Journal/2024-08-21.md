[Practical Patterns for Kotlin Coroutines in Production](https://appdevcon.nl/session/practical-patterns-for-kotlin-coroutines-in-production/)
+ `suspend fun` is not a coroutine, it is function that can suspend a coroutine
+ ![[Pasted image 20240821152142.png]]
+ supervisorScope ignores the child exceptions, allowing cases where, if you start $n$ coroutines from a single coroutine scope (supervisor), you can have some of those coroutines fail due to an exception thrown, and this _does not kill_ the parent supervisorScope, therefore the other child coroutines do not get cancelled.
+ Use `yield()` between CPU heavy operations / blocking operations
+ If you have suspending code in `finally` which _must run_, wrap it in `withContext(NonCancellable)`
