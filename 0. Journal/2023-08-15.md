[[Blue Green Deployments]]
+ https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html 2010
+ Have a completely automated deployment process.
+ Idea taken from the book Continuous Delivery, by Dave Farley and Jez Humble.
+ Deployment technique to minimize downtime
	+ Have two identical production environments, blue and green.
	+ Say blue is live. Do your final stage testing in green env.
	+ Once the software is working in the green environment, you switch the router so that all incoming requests go to the green environment - the blue one is now idle.
	+ Blue is the 
+ Rapid rollback
	+ if anything goes wrong you switch the router back to your blue environment. 
	+ To deal with missed transactions while Green was live, you may be able to feed transactions to both environments in such a way as to keep the blue environment as a backup when the green is live.
	+ Or you may be able to put the application in read-only mode before cut-over, run it for a while in read-only mode, and then switch it to read-write mode
+ Setups
	+ Need to be as identical as possible.
	+ e.g. different VMs running on the same (or different) hardware.
