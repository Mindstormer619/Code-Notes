[[ScyllaDB P99 Conf]]
+ Quantifying the Performance Impact of Shard-per-core Architecture
	+ speeding up networking in linux
	+ shards per core architecture
		+ ![[Pasted image 20231018211825.png]]
		+ traditional stacks suffer lock contention, cache contention, NUMA unfriendly
	+ scale up before you scale out
		+ why? more machines means more maintenance, for upgrades etc. more container overhead etc.
	+ ~~"Nodes must be small, in case they fail"~~
		+ doesn't!
		+ takes constant time to replace/add/remove a node
+ Jon Haddad: Distributed System Performance Troubleshooting Like You've Been Doing It for 20 Years
	+ seeing a performance problem
		+ Don't panic!
		+ don't just blame (the database)
			+ don't rush to conclusions
	+ methodology
		+ rethink assumptions
		+ ask the right questions
			+ don't go with vague questions like "is it slow?"
			+ ask specifics, e.g. p50, p99.
			+ what does the latency measure exactly
			+ ask if anything else in the env changed
			+ is it on a subset of the machines?
		+ narrow down the source
		+ think about the bigger picture
			+ e.g. don't blame a single microservice
		+ have high observability
			+ distributed tracing ([Dapper](https://research.google/pubs/pub36356/))
			+ alternatives: OpenTelemetry, Honeycomb, Zipkin
		+ all machines or one machine?
			+ one query or all queries?
		+ setup good dashboards
			+ grafana
	+ Throughput, Latency and Errors
	+ for hardware: Utilization, Saturation and Error Rate
		+ https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html
	+ understand your environment's limits
	+ profiling and flame graphs
		+ Linux: `perf`
		+ Java: async-profiler
+ High-Level Rust for Backend Programming ~ Adam Chalmers
	+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbleed
	+ autogenerate API schemas with Dropshot and OpenAPI
	+ Rust can be a high level programming language
		+ correctness, reliability, interop with high perf
		+ Rust backend prod https://zero2prod.com
	+ Perf and reliability are linked
		+ many backends don't need perf, just reliability
		+ but enough perf degradation can cause reliability degradation
	+ Tooling
		+ clippy, `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`
		+ Code generation with macros
	+ Keep 80% functional code, 20% imperative code
	+ Parallelism in Rust -- rule of thumb is Rayon is great for anything CPU-bound, Tokio is good for anything IO-bound.
	+ JSON + SQL gluing servers
		+ Serde for JSON
			+ autogenerating field names
			+ ![[Pasted image 20231018221844.png]]
		+ Diesel for SQL
			+ compile time correctness
			+ solves the dual-schema problem: SQL relations and proglang structs in sync
			+ automatically generates schema structs from SQL
			+ alternative: SQLx (from comments)
	+ you can guarantee how often types are used, like exclusive access to pool resources
+ Writing Low Latency Database Applications Even if Your Code Sucks ~ Glauber Costa
	+ basically put your data everywhere, because latency depends on place
	+ ![[Pasted image 20231018223525.png]]
	+ the Edge isn't necessarily serverless
		+ e.g. VMs with Fly.io
		+ both code and data need to be at the edge
	+ How?
		+ per-user data partitioning
		+ global data unfortunately needs replication, which has cost.
		+ data traffic is seasonal: scale certain locations down when not needed
		+ Cost of a GB: $0.10/mo, Cost of CPU: ~$20/mo
	+ Cheapest SQL DB
		+ SQLite? Can't add multi-instance replication
		+ libsql: fork of SQLite
			+ WAL virtualization
			+ HTTP-based protocol and server implementation
		+ Turso
			+ massive replication
			+ serverless or embedded
			+ primary writes, replicated reads
			+ https://blog.turso.tech/vercel-benchmarks-show-turso-has-low-latencies-everywhere-what-the-data-edge-is-good-for-7407579d4c88
			+ Turso is not a good solution for scylla-like write-heavy workloads.
+ A Case for Rust Higher Up the Stack ~ Carl Lerche
	+ (this is the guy who leads Tokio)
	+ vast majority of Rust growth has been on the infra level
	+ Rust is good for _high quality_ code
	+ 70% of high-severity C++ CVEs are related to memory safety
	+ Rust is not as productive, mostly because it's harder to learn
	+ Less developed ecosystem
		+ because the lang was positioned for systems programming, a lot of libs are pointed to raw perf over usability
	+ Rust can become easier to learn
	+ Hard parts: Traits and Lifetimes
	+ To make libs easier to use
		+ prefer enums over traits
		+ prefer values over lifetimes
			+ don't return references, clone them if you want
		+ prefer struct fields over accessors
		+ start by modeling data, not methods
			+ https://github.com/carllerche/mini-raft
		+ use indices for complex relationships
