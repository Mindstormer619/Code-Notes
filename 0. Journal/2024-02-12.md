+ 22:14 Why is Kafka fast? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUz1-msbOM
	+ for high throughput optimized
	+ Kafka relies on sequential IO
		+ disk access speed depends on data access patterns
		+ sequential is fast, random is slow for disks
		+ Kafka: append only log datastructure
		+ HDD: sequential ~100MB/s, random ~100KB/s
	+ Focus on efficiency
		+ zero copy principle
		+ without 0 copy
			+ disk -> OS Cache -> Kafka -> Socket buffer -> NIC buffer -> network
			+ ![[Pasted image 20240212221253.png]]
		+ with 0 copy
			+ disk -> OS Cache
			+ syscall called sendfile(): directly copies OS Cache -> NIC buffer
			+ done with DMA: Direct Memory Access. CPU not involved.
