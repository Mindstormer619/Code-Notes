+ Security Headers ~ https://saptaks.website
	+ HSTS
		+ Response header
		+ tells the browser to always use HTTPS for further requests to the domain
		+ `includeSubdomains` option to include all subdomains. Usually a good idea
	+ Referrer-Policy
		+ Response header
		+ Can be used to tell browser "when you navigate out of my domain to a different one, send only _this_ amount of info to the received domain using your `Referer`"
	+ X-Content-Type-Options
		+ Informs browser to always use the `Content-Type` header, never guess. Fail if not matching
	+ Clickjacking protection
		+ Clickjacking: put your website in an iframe, the outside website can track the clicks within the frame (you can make the iframe large enough to fit the entire frame so users don't suspect)
		+ X-Frame-Options
		+ Currently you can only prevent iframing (either entirely or on different origin)
