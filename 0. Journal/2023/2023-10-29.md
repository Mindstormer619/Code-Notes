	+ utop: repl for Ocaml 
	+ Ocaml has `ml` and `mli` files. The former is where the code lives, the latter contains type declarations which cannot be inferred by the compiler

## Appendix

### Ocaml Workshop

```ocaml
(*You can have type inference...*)
let four = 4
(*Or have explicit types...*)
let four: int = 4
(*Or put the type declaration in the mli file*)
val four: int (*in mli*)
let four = 4 (*in ml*)

(*----------------*)

(* All float operators are different. There is no overloading. *)
4. /. 2. (* 2. *)
5. +. 6. (* 11. *)

(*----------------*)
