+ [[Docker]]
	+ run chroot process in your system
	+ docker copies os filesystem on the container
	+ Docker Desktop is a VM
		+ on windows and Mac it doesn't actually run
		+ it runs like a VM situation
		+ WSL works though. Docker is Linux only. 
+ 10:07 [[Docker WASM Event]]
	+ Slack channel??
	+ [ ] Get the slides!
		+ github: collabnix/dockerbangalore
	+ CI/CD containerization
		+ ~ Sourav Maheshkar
		+ `pre-commit` plugin
			+ do pre-commit checks 
		+ ci cd makes managing model registry easier
		+ model registry: pretrained models versioned and stored, like docker registry for docker images
			+ huggingface
		+ [ ] Dev Containers
	+ What's new in Docker + Wasm
		+ ~ Ajeet Raina
			+ developer advocate @ docker
		+ Community driven projects
			+ docker labs: training for docker
			+ dockertools
			+ kubetools: collection of k8s tools
			+ Kubelabs: training for k8s
		+ WasmLabs: curated tutorials for wasm
		+ inner loop outer loop
			+ ![[20230819_110246.jpg]]
		+ Docker Desktop 
			+ docker init: don't create dockerfile manually
			+ compose file watch
			+ Rosetta 2
		+ Multi stage build
			+ you don't always need build time tools to run the binary
			+ so the production binary container can remove all the build dependencies and be super lightweight 
		+ `buildx --platform`
		+ docker init
			+ simplify creating docker assets
			+ uses best practices
		+ shell command `tree`
		+ compose watch
			+ if you make changes in code, you need to restart the container
			+ compose watch automatically restarts
		+ docker scout
			+ product integrated into docker
			+ layer view of dependencies, trying to find security vulnerabilities 
		+ [ ] containerD
		+ [ ] Wasi
			+ specification of how Wasm code interacts on host machine
		+ WASM
			+ ~~Binary based programming language where code runs on a web browser~~ it's not exactly a language 
			+ Binary *instruction format* for a stack based VM
			+ Emscripten compiler: C/++ t WASM
			+ compiled, not interpreted. 
			+ sandboxed from the rest of the browser
		+ [x] Why are there 4 separate runtimes for Wasm shipped with docker desktop?
			+ different runtimes for different purposes
			+ Spin, WasmEdge, WasmTime, Slight
		+ Blog post: Docker WASM better together
		+ https://launchpass.com/collabnix
	+ Docker scout
		+ makes sure docker image is secure
			+ analyzes image content and generates reports of package and vulns
			+ suggestions on remediating issues
			+ inspect and analyzes remote images without pulling them
		+ Integrating with CI tools
