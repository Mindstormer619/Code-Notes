+ [[Monolith]] from [[1. Projects/Book - Building Microservices/README|Book - Building Microservices]]
	+ Monolith: all functionality in the system must be deployed together
	+ Single Process Monolith
		+ all the code packed into a single process
		+ might have multiple instances for robustness or scaling
		+ usually read/store data from a DB
		+ ![[Single process monolith.canvas|Single process monolith]]
		+ DHH made the case effectively that such an architecture makes sense for smaller organization's.
	+ Modular Monolith
		+ Subset of the Single process monolith
		+ the single process consists of separate modules -- all still need to be combined together for deployment 
		+ needs well defined module boundaries for high degree of parallel work
		+ simpler to deploy than a microservice
		+ Shopify is an example of an organization that uses this well
		+ Downside: code modules are loosely coupled, but DB tends to lack that decomposition. Makes it very difficult to pull the monolith apart in the future. 
	+ Distributed Monolith
		+ > A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable. ~ Leslie Lamport
		+ Consists of multiple services, but for whatever reason, they all need to be deployed together
		+ Has all the disadvantages of both monoliths and a distributed system
		+ usually results in environments where not enough focus was placed on information hiding, cohesion of business functionality 
		+ highly coupled architecture causes changes to ripple across service boundaries
	+ Delivery Contention
		+ different developers wanting to change the same piece of code
		+ different teams wanting to push functionality at different times
		+ confusion for who owns what
		+ (Think about the issues in GS with deployment Thursday queues )
		+ generally a much bigger problem in monoliths than microservices
	+ Advantages of monoliths
		+ simpler deployment topology 
		+ simpler dev workflows, monitoring, troubleshooting, e2e testing 
		+ simplified code reuse
		+ monolith is not legacy! Perfectly valid architecture choice. Consider it the default option
		+ look for reasons to be convinced to use microservices, rather than making it the default 
+ [[Microservices Enabling Technology]]
	+ Don't immediately adopt lots of new tech. As you ramp up, look for issues caused by your existing distributed system, then look for tech to mitigate them.
	+ microservices require an understanding of the supporting technology to such a degree that previous distinctions between logical and physical architecture can be problematic 
	+ Log Aggregation and Distributed Tracing
		+ bare minimum: implement a log Aggregation system. Consider this a prerequisite
		+ allow you to collect and aggregate logs from across services, provides a central place for analysis, can provide active alerting mechanism
		+ author recommendation: Humio
		+ implement Correlation IDs. A single ID used for a related set of service calls. Makes isolating logs for a particular request flow easy. 
		+ Jaeger: distributed tracing
		+ Lightstep, Honeycomb. Make it easier to explore the state of your running system
	+ Containers and Kubernetes
		+ Containers provide lightweight way to provision isolated execution for service instances
		+ faster spin up time, more cost effective 
		+ Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes) allow managing containers across lots of underlying machines
		+ Only adopt containers/K8s once the overhead of managing deployment becomes a headache. Not worth it for very few microservices.
		+ ensure someone else manages the Kubernetes cluster for you (managed service on cloud provider). Running your own K8s can be a significant amount of work!
	+ Streaming
		+ Apache Kafka for streaming data between microservices 
			+ message permanence
			+ compaction 
			+ scale to handle large volumes of messages
			+ stream processing in the form of KSQLDB
		+ Debezium
			+ stream from traditional data sources to Kafka
	+ Public Cloud, Serverless
		+ GCP, Azure, AWS
		+ Huge array of managed service and deployment option 
		+ Use these managed services -- they are better able to deal with these tasks. 
		+ (Consider ThoughtWorks tech radar, we have an article on this)
		+ Serverless: hides the underlying machines. Message brokers, storage, DBs. 
+ Advantages of Microservices #todo
	+ Tech heterogeneity. We can pick the right tool/language/stack/DB for each job rather than selecting a more standardized approach as a lowest common denominator.
		+ eg social graph for users in a graph DB, posts stored in document DB, images in blob store
		+ can quickly try out and adopt new tech without risking a large surface area or a complex overhaul. 
		+ upgrading tech becomes easier and less risky
	+ Robustness
		+ Key concept: bulkhead. Service boundaries become obvious bulkheads.
		+ a component may fail, but the failure should not cascade.
		+ we can build microservices systems to handle the total failure of some of the constituent services and degrade functionality accordingly
			+ e.g. swiggy often shows a "This service is unavailable" page. But all of Swiggy isn't down, just a specific service. 
		+ distributed systems can have entirely new sources of failure that we don't need to deal with in monoliths. Else we can end up with a _less_ robust system when migrating to microservices. 
	+ Scaling
		+ you can Target scaling at the exact Microservices that need it
		+ no need to scale the entire system uniformly like you would with a monolith
		+ eg. Consider factorio. We scale by adding new assemblers where production is slow, or more smelters etc. We don't just create a copy of the entire system
	+ Ease of deployment
		+ A one-line change to a million-line monolith requires the entire app to be deployed in order to release the change.
		+ high risk of things going wrong because of huge change deltas and infrequent releases
		+ Microservices code deployed more quickly, quick isolation of problems and fast rollback
	+ Organisational Alignment
		+ Allows smaller teams working on smaller codebases, aligning the architecture to the org
	+ Composability
		+ seams in the system that are addressable by outside parties
		+ allow functionality to get consumed and reused in different ways
+ Microservice Pain Points
	+ Developer experience
		+ If you're working with tens of microservices, it might not be possible to run the entire system on one machine. Especially true if using cloud services or heavy runtimes (like JVM)
		+ "Developing in the cloud". Feedback cycles can suffer greatly.
		+ ideally limit the scope of what one dev needs to work on
	+ technology overload
		+ danger of adopting a lot of new alien technology simply because "we can"
		+ microservices may give the _option_ for each microservice to be written in different language/runtime/DB â€” but these are options, not requirements.
