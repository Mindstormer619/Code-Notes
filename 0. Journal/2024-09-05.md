## Log

+ It's cumbersome to store events in a DB. We can rather store it in a log.
	+ ordered sequence of the events
+ easy to build logs at scale.
+ Kafka is a system for managing these logs. This log is called Topic = ordered collection of events stored in a durable way
	+ replicated, stored on disk
+ topics can store data for indefinite periods
	+ can be enormous, they don't have to be small
	+ persistent records of events
+ event = thing happening in the business
+ event -> stored in topic
+ microservices can consume a message from a topic, write to another topic
+ realtime analysis by consuming a topic stream
+ Kafka Connect = pluggable modules to connect various systems to and from topics
