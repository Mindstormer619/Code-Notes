+ 22:14 Why is Kafka fast? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUz1-msbOM
	+ for high throughput optimized
	+ Kafka relies on sequential IO
		+ disk access speed depends on data access patterns
		+ sequential is fast, random is slow for disks
		+ Kafka: append only log datastructure
		+ HDD: sequential ~100MB/s, random ~100KB/s
	+ Focus on efficiency
		+ zero copy principle
		+ without 0 copy
			+ disk -> OS Cache -> Kafka -> Socket buffer -> NIC buffer -> network
			+ ![[Pasted image 20240212221253.png]]
		+ with 0 copy
			+ disk -> OS Cache
			+ syscall called `sendfile()`: directly copies OS Cache -> NIC buffer
			+ done with DMA: Direct Memory Access. CPU not involved.
	+ 📝 ByteByteGo seems to be a great YT channel for system design content.
+ 10 very promising Open Source Projects you haven’t heard of https://youtu.be/qXUl3VsbA6o
	+ PartyTown
		+ runs JS libraries that don't need to interact with the UI (like analytics) on a web worker
	+ MeiliSearch 🦀
		+ fast open source self-hosted search engine
		+ cheaper than ElasticSearch
		+ alternative: Zinc (implemented in Go)
	+ tRPC
		+ type-safe RPC
	+ NocoDB
		+ Open source Airtable alternative
		+ Smart spreadsheet (over a self-hosted DB)
	+ DanfoJS: pandas in JS
	+ Mantine: good UI components
