[[IndiaFOSS 3.0]]
+ Vyaakaran ~ Akash Hamirwasia
	+ Building a language to express formal language and automata theory
	+ Jflap.org
	+ grammophone
	+ Hard part is writing grammars that work the way you expect it to
		+ vyaakaran console
		+ generates accepted, not accepted strings
	+ [x] What did he use to make the PPT?
		+ slantit.app
	+ how did I build it
		+ typescript
		+ Vue 3
		+ Svelte - static website
		+ windi CSS
	+ Simulating turing machine
	+ learnings
		+ it's ok to reinvent the wheel
			+ you learn more about the wheel than the users
			+ you can find better ways to build it
			+ peel a layer of abstraction and it opens more things to explore
		+ DSLs are practical and fun to work on 
			+ blenderskool/lexico
		+ Build stuff that seem impossible to build
			+ more fun as a challenge
			+ even if you fail it makes you a better engineer
			+ success is very rewarding 
		+ A Foss project is not just a collection of files
			+ community and vision matters more
	+ Vyaakaran is currently not open source
		+ ... yet
		+ okay he literally opensourced it in the talk
+ YouTube edu: Build With Hussain ~ Hussain @ Frappe
	+ from Bastar, Chattisgarh
	+ Started working as a TA on a Udemy course
		+ [ ] how do you get started on this?
	+ Writing blogs
		+ too much effort
		+ lot of things filter out
		+ You make assumptions as to what the reader knows
		+ hard to show the full picture
	+ Livestreaming
		+ interactive
		+ raw
		+ starting is the hardest
	+ doubts
		+ what if I make mistakes
		+ what if I teach something wrong
		+ am I the right person to do it
	+ Currently 50+ videos
	+ 300,000 watch minutes
	+ non obvious benefits
		+ sustainability: paid courses to fund OSS
		+ Impact 
	+ [ ] He's open to collaborate 
	+ buildwithhussain.dev
+ Julia
	+ two language problem
		+ Ousterhout Dichotomy 
		+ language needs to write fast and also run fast
	+ language features 
		+ dynamic language
		+ multiple dispatch
		+ JIT, GCed
		+ extensive FFI
		+ inbuilt package manager
	+ GPU support 
		+ native support for common backends
		+ vendor abstract kernels
	+ SciML
	+ CliMA
		+ climate modeling alliance
		+ fluid dynamics models, earth system models and more
	+ imaging the black hole
		+ perf went from 1 week on a cluster to 1 hour in single CPU
	+ recursat sped up by 15000
+ https://cybernity.group/
+ Vulnerability DB
	+ hritik.sh
	+ VulnTotal
		+ comparison engine for vuln DBs
	+ https://public.vulnerablecode.io
+ HBase @ Flipkart
	+ functional requirements
		+ consistency vs availability
		+ primary key lookups
		+ architectural tradeoff
	+ non-functional
		+ maintainability, scalability 
	+ LSM data structure for high throughput 
	+ multitenancy
	+ Flipkart tech blog: Hbase multitenancy
+ https://ravenapp.info/#
	+ Redisearch
+ Open source hardware
	+ KiCAD opensource EDA tool
	+ 3d visualisation!!!
+ Plane: open source project management
+ AI policy ~ Anupam Guha (IIT prof)
	+ Arg 3: "bias" has gotten treated like an optimization problem
		+ gendered datasets for instance are a reflection on epistemological systems of reality
		+ you cannot unbias human knowledge production
	+ in the policy space, be suspicious when companies start giving money to conferences that speak against their discipline 
		+ when AI companies give money to conferences that talk about bias, beware!
	+ digiyatra
		+ paper about "responsible AI"
		+ violates privacy
		+ shooting and crying -- advocating "responsible AI" and doing irresponsible things 
	+ There is never a question of "should we deploy it", only "how to deploy it responsibly"
	+ stochasticity and opaqueness cannot be engineered away. They are fundamental aspects of machine learning
	+ reification (thingification)
		+ Not a real thing, but people make a thing out of it through sheer collective will
		+ e.g. physiognomy, pathognomy
	+ Effective AI and Emotion AI are frauds
	+ Benchmarks do not reflect truth, but often create truth
		+ McNamara fallacy 
		+ precision is not truth
		+ chasing SOTA alters the field
	+ problem with aggregate metrics
	+ explainability doesn't exist
		+ at best they can give you a heatmap
		+ they are not explanations to people who use these systems on the ground who make the decisions 
		+ even technical explainability doesn't really exist as advertised yet
	+ wicked problem
		+ governance of Actually Existing AI is a political problem
