[[Domain Driven Design]]
+ ![DDD Talk by AHL](https://youtu.be/6nrRfCkeAKU)
+ ddd is for developers, not architects
+ 1919, pre ddd
	+ BAUHAUS - art and architecture school by Walter Gropius
	+ made diverse physical things
	+ "Form follows function"
		+ the design of the thing follows directly from the problem, the needs of the user.
+ 2003, The Blue Book -- DDD by Eric Evans
	+ has both small hands on stuff as well as large design stuff
	+ "Put the model to work"
		+ to be able to solve a problem in software, focus on the actual complexity of the problem itself. Not an abstracted view of it.
		+ Take the understanding of the business problem and put that into software
+ Ubiquitous Language
	+ to avoid a breakdown in communication between business and engineering.
	+ the code must contain the ubiquitous language
+ Model Driven Design
	+ Problem: the shared language does not flow all the way to the code
	+ Solution: tie the code directly to the model, look for drifts ("fractures") and fix them
