Video - What I talk about when I talk about [[Domain Driven Design]] ~ Andrew Harmel-Law
+ ![What I talk about when I talk about Domain Driven Design ~ Andrew Harmel-Law](https://youtu.be/6nrRfCkeAKU)
+ ddd is for developers, not architects
+ 1919, pre ddd
	+ BAUHAUS - art and architecture school by Walter Gropius
	+ made diverse physical things
	+ "Form follows function"
		+ the design of the thing follows directly from the problem, the needs of the user.
+ 2003, The Blue Book -- DDD by Eric Evans
	+ has both small hands on stuff as well as large design stuff
	+ "Put the model to work"
		+ to be able to solve a problem in software, focus on the actual complexity of the problem itself. Not an abstracted view of it.
		+ Take the understanding of the business problem and put that into software
+ Ubiquitous Language
	+ to avoid a breakdown in communication between business and engineering.
	+ the code must contain the ubiquitous language
+ Model Driven Design
	+ Problem: the shared language does not flow all the way to the code
	+ Solution: tie the code directly to the model, look for drifts ("fractures") and fix them
	+ wherever you are "translating", you're doing it wrong.
+ Modules AKA packages
	+ Packages have domain meaning
	+ Problem: Cognitive overload in codebase
	+ Solution: Modularize, but keep using the domain to identify and name the modules
	+ don't name it `utils`
+ Entities (aka Reference Objects)
	+ Problem: Representing the _identity and lifecycle_ of key domain elements in the model
	+ Solution: Focus on both explicitly, leave the rest of the work to other parts of the model
+ Aggregates
	+ Problem: Keeping closely associated but separate domain-things consistent when creating/saving/retrieving
	+ Solution: Treat them as a unit, control access from a single entry point, minimize other relationships
	+ These are basically microservices.
+ Bounded Contexts
	+ Problem: we have more than one model. How to keep it separate and distinct?
	+ Solution: draw a distinct boundary around each model. Keep it clear what is, and what isn't in a specific model
+ Context Map
	+ to map across bounded contexts

+ 2013 Implementing DDD ~ Vaughn Vernon
	+ Domain Events
		+ to solve how to capture something happening in the domain
	+ Hexagonal architecture

+ Benefits
	+ continuous code review
	+ cross-training
	+ well-factored code
	+ ![[Pasted image 20240809192254.png]]
+ Drawbacks
	+ ![[Pasted image 20240809192337.png]]
+ how to get started?
	+ be honest about the fact that you've never paired (even if it's specific -- like I have never remote-paired)
	+ pairing etiquette -- be extra courteous, say when they are stuck. "Do you mind if I drive for a second?" Don't just grab the mouse.
	+ pairing and TDD go hand in hand
	+ ping-pong pairing
		+ one dev writes the failing test, second person writes the code to make it pass and then writes the next failing test.
		+ can help rebalance if one person is driving too much
+ when do you switch pairs? context switching etc.
	+ general rule can be used -- like "switch every day"
	+ will usually ask during morning standup "are there any pairs that would like to stick?"
		+ if they want more context on something they are working on
	+ new developers usually stick the same pair until they are done with the first feature they are pairing on.
	+ don't have a super rigid structure where you HAVE to switch
	+ also don't make pairs stick for days on end.
	+ generally split work in such a way that you can switch pairs frequently
+ how do we track who's working on what?
	+ some tools have support for that. e.g. Pivotal Tracker
	+ git duet
	+ git pair from Pivotal
	+ may have to dig deeper if you want strict tracking
+ big question: How do you convince managers / boss / clients / budgeting?
	+ talk about all the benefits
		+ put in pairing for a brief period and track your metrics.
		+ confident that it will be a better picture post-pairing
	+ "what does done mean?"
		+ pair programming reduces time spent in all the other phases in delivering "done" software -- like QA, requirements analysis and understanding, bugfixes, even prod support.
	+ empirical studies
		+ proven to reduce overall time to develop software
	+ say it with conviction and honesty
	+ only thing that will work over time is to tell them "trust us, we will do this for this period of time and you *will* see the benefits"
	+ "we're shifting time spent on ramp-up, documentation writing, onboarding activities, code review into the regular day"
	+ "you can transfer knowledge really effectively among engineers"
