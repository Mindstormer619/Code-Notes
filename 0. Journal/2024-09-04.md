The Best Programmer I Know | Daniel Terhorst-North https://youtu.be/D6aUoGK2rkk
+ Just start
	+ Don't procrastinate
		+ start literally anywhere
		+ doing *is* researching -- do not spend time pre-researching before you start
		+ We are all kinesthetic learners, we need to do to learn things.
	+ Know that you don't know
		+ doesn't matter what you know, you're likely wrong anyway
	+ Iterate wildly
+ Build a product
	+ Invest in the outcome
		+ if you can solve the outcome with less code, it's better
		+ "I will write the best code I can, but will have no emotional attachment to the code"
	+ Study the domain
		+ represent the domain in the code
	+ Watch your users
		+ simplify and eliminate the things that frustrate your users
+ Solve for _now_
	+ Figure out your "change event horizon"
		+ _How long does it take you to actually effect that change?_ If it takes you only until the next release or so, solve for now.
	+ Learn to see what is really there
		+ It takes conditioning and practice
	+ Solve the real problem
		+ Related: [[XY Problem]]
		+ It'll probably reduce your dependencies
	+ Strive for simplicity
		+ Write the README, then do embarrassment-driven refactoring
		+ If something in the README embarrasses you, use it as a good driving point to simplify things
+ Choose the right tool for the product, not the team
	+ Code outlives teams, and data outlives both code and organizations
	+ Do the simplest thing, not the easiest
		+ https://dannorth.net/go/simple-made-easy
		+ Minimize distance to the solution space
	+ The right tool may change over time
		+ _Make the change easy, then make the easy change_ | Kent Beck
+ Make the change easy
	+ Minimize blast radius
		+ build small, optimize for composability
		+ Spike and Stabilize
			+ treat everything like a spike
			+ Related: [[Build one to throw away]]
			+ you need to re-massage code you intend to keep
	+ Reduce, reuse, recycle
		+ when it's composable, you can always re-compose and de-compose
	+ https://cupid.dev #todo 
	+ Architecture as options
		+ Choices that you make, with costs of reversal
		+ find architecture decisions where the cost of reversal is low
+ Be a polyglot
	+ Learn lots of languages, different paradigms etc.
		+ Try AoC.
	+ Be _really_ "full-stack"
		+ figure out what makes a great webpage, a great API, great architecture
		+ Redesign the process!
		+ Use hardware
		+ challenge the premise
+ Care about others
	+ Pair with someone, or teach them. Help others learn
	+
