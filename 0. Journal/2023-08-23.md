> Lately, when a job description talks about being an agile, fast-paced environment with rapidly changing requirements... that tells me they have bad management and I definitely don't want to work there. Instead, I look for places which say they need someone self-directed who can figure out what needs to be done and do it, without having to be micromanaged. At my last job, I talked to my manager like once a month, along with casual chatter with the team over IRC, and it was great for everyone involved. When upper management inflicted scrum on everyone though, everything fell apart -- people left, projects failed, and eventually they cancelled almost everything and laid off a third of the company.
> > Good call. I saw one once that says "thrives on ambiguity". Uh, no.
