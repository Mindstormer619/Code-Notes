# [[MongoDB]] Aggregation Pipelines

An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents:
- Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.
- The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
- An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.

> ðŸ’¡ Aggregation pipelines run with the [`db.collection.aggregate()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/#mongodb-method-db.collection.aggregate) method do not modify documents in a collection, unless the pipeline contains a [`$merge`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-merge) or [`$out`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/out/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-out) stage.

```js
db.orders.aggregate( [
   // Stage 1: Filter pizza order documents by pizza size
   {
      $match: { size: "medium" }
   },
   // Stage 2: Group remaining documents by pizza name and calculate total quantity
   {
      $group: { _id: "$name", totalQuantity: { $sum: "$quantity" } }
   }
] )
```

The [`$match`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-match) stage:
- Filters the pizza order documents to pizzas with a `size` of `medium`.
- Passes the remaining documents to the [`$group`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-group) stage.

The [`$group`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-group) stage:
- Groups the remaining documents by pizza `name`.
- Uses [`$sum`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/#mongodb-group-grp.-sum) to calculate the total order `quantity` for each pizza `name`. The total is stored in the `totalQuantity` field returned by the aggregation pipeline.
