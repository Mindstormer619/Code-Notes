> Created: 2023-02-13 19:38

The majority of software cost is in its ongoing maintenance â€” fixing bugs, keeping systems operational, adding changes based on updated requirements, repaying technical debt etc.

Design principles for software system maintainability:

+ **[[Operability]].** Make it easy for ops teams to keep the system running smoothly.
+ **[[Simplicity]].** Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system.
+ **[[Evolvability]].** Make it easy for engineers to make changes in the system, allowing for unanticipated usecases as requirements change. Also called *extensibility.*
