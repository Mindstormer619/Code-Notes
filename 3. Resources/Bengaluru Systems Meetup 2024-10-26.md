## Faster and more efficient JS tooling

> ~ Srijan Paul (@injuly)

ESLint, the linter. Prettier, the autoformatter (uses CST to parse JS code and rewrites it in a prettier format). Babel, the tools that you do use most often depend on it, it's a lot of things which is a modern parser for JS which adds polyfills including some outside the JS standards (like `if` expressions).

Biggest USP for ESLint is that it supports JS, JSX, TS, TSX, Vue, Svelte etc. etc. Pretty much all of the derived languages etc. Also supports ESQuery, which is a query language to query your parse trees.

Contentions for ESLint:
+ Performance isn't great (felt most)
+ Limited to the AST.
