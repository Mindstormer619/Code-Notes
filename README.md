# Code Notes

My repository of software-related notes, currently written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Reading these notes

While this is viewable using general Markdown viewers (including the one Github itself provides), for true parity, it's best to install Obsidian and navigate the notes there. Obsidian uses some special syntax for embedding images / other documents, and for linking between notes, that is unsupported in generic Markdown.

If you have ideas for how I can (without cost!) publish these notes in a way that can read/navigate the Obsidian flavor of Markdown correctly, do let me know. I'm not planning on springing for the paid version of Obsidian anytime soon.
