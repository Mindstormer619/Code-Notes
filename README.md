# Code Notes

My repository of software-related notes, currently written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). These notes are primarily written with one intended audience member: me. If you do get value out of these (or have any suggestions for improving them), [do let me know](https://t.me/Mindstormer619). 

## Structure

The main organization method is using the [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) system to provide actionable structure to my notes. This means that **absolute or relative path links are not permalinks!** The notes will keep moving around as I find new or different uses for them. Of course, if you clone this down and open the vault in Obsidian, you'll see inter-note links working perfectly fine (as Obsidian remaps links when notes are renamed or moved around).

## Reading these notes

While this is viewable using general Markdown viewers (including the one Github itself provides), for true parity, it's best to install Obsidian and navigate the notes there. Obsidian uses some special syntax for embedding images / other documents, and for linking between notes, that is unsupported in generic Markdown.

If you have ideas for how I can (without cost!) publish these notes in a way that can read/navigate the Obsidian flavor of Markdown correctly, do let me know. I'm not planning on springing for the paid version of Obsidian anytime soon.
